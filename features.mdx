## Document Organization Tools

You organize documentation using hierarchical folders, tags, and custom metadata. Create nested structures for large projects and apply labels for quick filtering.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folders" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace and select **New Folder**. Name it descriptively, such as `api-reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tags" icon="tag">
    Edit a page and assign tags like `v1.0` or `internal`. Use them in queries later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Metadata" icon="settings">
    Configure page-level YAML frontmatter for SEO or custom fields.

````yaml

title: API Endpoint
tags: ["api", "v2"]
status: "draft"

````

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions like `kebab-case` for folders to improve discoverability.

## Collaboration and Version Control

Team members collaborate seamlessly with real-time edits, comments, and full Git-based version control. You review changes, revert commits, and merge branches directly in the interface.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Real-time Editing" icon="edit-3">
    Multiple users edit simultaneously. Changes appear live with user indicators.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Version History" icon="git-branch">
    View diffs and restore previous versions.

````javascript
// Example: Fetch version history via API
const history = await fetch('/api/pages/my-doc/versions');
const versions = await history.json();
console.log(versions); // [{ id: "v1.2", date: "2024-10-01", author: "user1" }]
````

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Merge Requests" icon="git-pull-request">
    Propose changes for approval with inline comments.
  </Tab>

## Search and Indexing Capabilities

Duyên Phan indexes all content automatically, supporting full-text search, tag filters, and advanced queries. You find pages by keyword, author, or custom metadata in milliseconds.

| Feature | Description | Example Query |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Full-text | Matches across titles and body | `authentication flow` |
| Tags | Filters by labels | `tag:v2 AND status:draft` |
| Metadata | Searches custom fields | `author:duyen status:published` |

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">
  Combine operators: `title:"API Guide" OR tag:feature >date:2024-01-01`.
</Expandable>
